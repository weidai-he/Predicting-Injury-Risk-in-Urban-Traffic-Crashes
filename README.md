# Predicting-Injury-Risk-in-Urban-Traffic-Crashes
This project uses machine learning to predict injury outcomes in traffic crashes in Chicago, leveraging a dataset of ~835,000 crash records from 2015 to August 2025. Classification models (Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost, LDA) are applied to features like weather, road conditions, and traffic controls. XGBoost achieved the highest AUC (0.743), balancing sensitivity (58.9%) and specificity (81.5%). Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation code in R, addressing class imbalance with SMOTE. Ideal for researchers in urban safety, machine learning, and transportation analytics.
